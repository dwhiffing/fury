[**Soviet Amphibious
forces**](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1979-06-01.pdf)

The Soviet Union maintains amphibious forces at a high degree of
readiness in all fleet areas. The main task in wartime is to secure the
maritime flanks, outflank defending forces and secure beachheads for
follow on regular army forces to exploit. It is unlikely that amphibious
forces will be used for power projections as they would be in the west
although amphibious ships have been very useful delivering equipment to
Soviet allies and exerting a forward presence in trouble areas during
peacetime.

**Naval Infantry**

Soviet Naval Infantry (NI) is a relatively light force meant for
surprise and shock action. Unlike the US Marines, Soviet Naval Infantry
will usually not use helicopter insertion to support an amphibious
assault, instead that will be done by airborne troops and there is an
airborne or air landing battalion integral to each NI Brigade (NI
Regiments only have three NI Battalions). Each of the three western
fleets has a NI Brigade, while the Pacific Fleet has a NI Division with
an Air-Landing Regiment and two NI Regiments, one in cadre state but
activated for Northern Fury:

-   55<sup>th</sup> NI Division at Vladivostok (Pacific Fleet)

-   63rd Guards *Kirkenneskaya* Brigade at Pechenga (Northern Fleet)

-   175th Brigade, at Tumanny in the North (independent but affiliated
    with Northern Fleet)

-   336th Guards Brigade at Baltiysk (Baltic Fleet)

-   810th Brigade, at Sevastopol (Black Sea Fleet)

From an equipment standpoint the NI has retired most of its PT-76 light
tanks in favour of T-62 and T-72 MBTs but about 1,500 (of 12,000
produced) have been retained because of their ability to swim. Most
BRT-60s have been replaced by BTR-80s.

One unique formation is [1<sup>st</sup> Fortified
Area](http://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/1ur.htm) in the Vladivostok area, with
five Machine Gun battalions and several fortified artillery and rocket
launcher battalions.

[**Ivan Rogov (Large Landing
Ship)**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/ivan_rogov_class.htm)

The Ivan Rogov class or Project 1174 is the largest amphibious ship in
the Soviet Navy. They have a bow ramp and a well deck enabling them to
operate as an LST and land its cargo over the beach; or as an LPD in a
stand off assault by dispatching helicopters and landing craft which
exit from the stern dock and transport troops to the beach. Typically,
four
[Ka-29](http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka29_helix_b.htm)
assault transport helicopters and various fully loaded landing craft are
embarked but these can be replaced for extra cargo. The landing craft
either three Gus Class (Project 1205) troop life hovercraft or two Lebed
Class (Project 1206) air cushion vessels and a Ondatra Class (Project
1176) landing craft. A fourth ship of this class was never completed but
in Northern Fury it has been launched and recently put in commission,
its name is Vasiliy Trushin, named for Hero of Soviet Union Major
General Vasiliy Trushin who commanded several Naval Infantry brigades
from 1942 to 1946 in the Pacific Fleet and Baltic Fleets.

The ships are designed to carry a reinforced battalion of Naval Infantry
and would form the corps of a Brigade assault force. Accommodation is
provided for a 550-man battalion including up to 23 armored vehicles
including up to ten MBT. Alternatively, if the landing craft are removed
these ships can transport up to 46 tanks or 79 BTR type APCs or similar
vehicles, or 120 trucks and 500 troops, or 1730 tons of cargo.

[**Ropucha (Large Landing
Ship)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ropucha-class_landing_ship)

There are three versions of these Project 775 ships but they are
essentially the same with minor differences in armaments and
electronics. They all have both a bow ramp and stern door and are
designed as RO-RO (Roll on – Roll off) ships, theoretically they can be
connected to form a causeway when unloading onto the beach. 28 were
built in Poland for Soviet use, with one being exported to Yemen, the
remainder are in service with the various Soviet Fleets.

They are designed to deliver the better part of a Naval Infantry
battalion directly onto the beach, and in that configuration they carry
340 troops and 10 MBT; or the tanks can be switched out for 12 BTRs or
other combinations of tanks, APCs, armored vehicles and trucks.
Alternatively, BTRs and PT-76 light tanks (mostly retired by Northern
Fury) can swim out of the bow doors and on to the beach. They can also
be configured to carry 500 tons of cargo directly to the beach.

**[Alligator Class (Large Landing
Ship)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator-class_landing_ship)**

These Project 1171 ships were built in four minor sub-classes which are
all essentially the same but with different engine and mechanical
systems and some variation in defensive armament. In total 15 units were
built and it seems that they were designed to do the heavy lifting in an
amphibious assault. They were probably paired with a Ropucha class to
lift a Naval Infantry battalion as they can carry up to 20 MBT or up to
47 BTR type armored vehicles or about 50 trucks. They can also carry
between 3-400 troops in various configurations which combined with a
Ropucha would work out to a reinforced battalion, however some sources
state that the accommodation was more rudimentary. Like a Ropucha these
ships can either land directly on the beach or have amphibious vehicles
swim from their open bow doors.

[**Polnocny Class (Medium Landing Ship) Project 770, 771, and
773**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polnocny-class_landing_ship)

These medium landing ships are deployed in large numbers, 68 for the
Soviets alone. All were built in Poland and are equipped with a bow ramp
for beach landing, they come in three main sub-classes:

**Polnocny A**: With four minor variations there were 35 of these built
for the Soviets, Poland also built ten for themselves. These ships can
carry four or five MBT several more armored vehicles and about 200
troops. Exports included Bulgaria (2), Egypt (3), India (2), Indonesia
(1), Syria (3), Somalia (1), and Yemen (3); leaving 20 serving in the
various Soviet fleets. Historically some of these were retired in the
early 1990s but are still active in Northern Fury.

**Polnocny B**: With two main variations, there were 25 built for the
Soviets, Poland also had 11 of them. These ships can carry six MBT
several more armored vehicles and about 200 troops. Exports included
five built for Cuba (2) and Viet Nam (3) plus five transferred from
Soviet fleets to Angola (3), and Ethiopia (2). Therefore leaving 20
serving in the various Soviet fleets. Historically some of these were
retired in the early 1990s but are still active in Northern Fury.

**Polnocny C**: There were 24 of these built, eight for the Soviets,
eight more for India and four each for Iraq and Lybia. These ships can
carry six MBT several more armored vehicles and about 200 troops.
Historically some of these were retired in the early 1990s but are still
active in Northern Fury.

| Class               | Northern | Pacific | Baltic | Black Sea | Remarks |

**Landing Craft**: Small beach landing craft which are capable of
short-to-shore transport over short distances or ship-to-shore from an
amphibious ship. These are generally of a traditional design similar to
and in some cases copies of World War Two designs; they generally carry
one or two vehicles up to MBT size and varying number of troops with
very little shelter.

[**Ondatra Class: Project
1176**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondatra-class_landing_craft)

These small landing craft can carry one MBT or two trucks and about 20
troops. In all 36 were built in time for Northern Fury and one can be
carried on the Ivan Rogov class ships.

**[Vydra class: Project
106](http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/GG08+-+Vydra+class.html)**

The Vydra class can carry two, perhaps three MBT or other vehicles or up
to 100 troops under some cover. The Soviet navy operates 56 of this
class and the Bulgarian navy has 11 more.

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\amphibious\media\image7.jpg" style="width:10.66667in;height:6.66667in" alt="A large ship in a body of water Description automatically generated" />

**Other**: there are several classes of older landing craft, mostly the
Project 306, 450, 1785, and T-4, many have been scrapped or converted
into tugs, lightships, service ships and other - but an estimate of
about 100 remain in service.

**Landing Craft Air Cushioned (LCAC):** The Soviet navy was a pioneer in
this field and placed significant priority on the development of these
craft. The main advantage is speed which enhances surprise and limits
the time troops are vulnerable but also this type generally avoids sea
mines, can use more rugged coastline and is suitable for shore-to-shore
transport of troops. The main disadvantage is fuel use so operations
must be planned carefully.

**[Gus Class Assault Landing Hovercraft (Project
1205)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus-class_LCAC):** A small
troop-carrying hovercraft with a limited range of 200 nautical miles
traveling between 43 and 50 Knots. The capacity varies based on the
range that needs to be achieved but is between 25 and 50 assault troops,
the can also carry 4 tons of cargo. In all there were 29 units (some
sources say 32) of this class built before production turned to the
Lebed class. Three of these can be carried on the Ivan Rogov class
ships.

**[Lebed Class Air Cushion landing craft (Project
1206)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebed-class_LCAC):** Four times the
displacement of the Gus Class, the 20 units built for the Soviet Navy
are similar to the US Navy’s LCAC but were in service well before it was
adopted. They can each carry 1 MBT or 2 armored vehicles or 120 troops
or 37 tons of cargo – but only to a range of 100 nautical mines at 50
Knots. Two can be carried on the Ivan Rogov class ships.

**[Tsaplya Class Air cushion landing craft (Project
12061)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsaplya-class_LCAC):** A
lengthened version of the Lebed Class, 12 units were completed (as
planned, construction of the last two was not terminated) and can carry
1 MBT or 2-3 armored vehicles or 130 troops or 42 tons of cargo. All are
in the Pacific Fleet and focused on the Amer River border with China.

[**Utenok Class Air Cushion Landing Assault Boat (Project
1209)**](http://warshipsresearch.blogspot.com/2016/11/russian-air-cushion-landing-assault.html)
These two assault hovercraft were used in the Baltic fleet and carry 60
troops or 6 tons of cargo at a speed of 60 knots to a range of 200
nautical miles. These were probably designed to provide high speed troop
lift in accompaniment for the Lebed class.

[**Aist Class Small Air Cushion Landing Ships (Project
12321)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aist-class_LCAC): Considered
ships and not craft, the descriptor of ‘small’ is somewhat misleading.
Although the number built is often 20, they were historically in serial
production so in Northern Fury there are 24 available. The Aist class
can carry two T-72 type MBT or 4-5 armored vehicles or 80 troops or 73
tons of cargo and have a range of 120 nautical miles at a speed of 50
knots, although they can travel at 70 knots if needed this reduces their
range significantly.

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\amphibious\media\image12.png" style="width:7.14783in;height:5.07496in" />

**Zubr Class Small Air Cushion Landing Ships (Project 12322)**: These
are the worlds largest hovercraft with a displacement of over 550 tons
In Northern Fury all that were under construction have been completed
for a total of 14 now available. These ships essentially carry a company
of Naval infantry (10 x APC and 120 troops) or a troop of tanks with a
capacity of three MBT or 8-10 armored vehicles or 360 troops or 150 tons
of cargo. The range is 300 nautical miles at 55 knots although its top
speed is 63 knots.

**Civilian ships**: The Soviet Navy does not have enough amphibious lift
to follow up its NI forces with heavier ground forces so it needs to use
civilian shipping. Nationalizing civilian shipping should not be an
issue as there are more than 1,000 ships available for use as military
support, many will be at sea or unavailable in time of war but
sufficient will be ready to assist military forces. Key amongst these
ships are:

-   Two (2) SeaBee barge carriers built by Finland in the late 1970s.
    The same Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) system is used by the US Navy
    and the original designs were purchased from the US. These two
    ships; the [*Yulius
    Fuchik*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Yulius_Fuchik) and *[Tibor
    Szamueli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Tibor_Szamueli)* each
    carried 26 Lighters (barges) each displacing 1,300 tons, an
    additional 56 LASH barges, two pusher tugs and 1,552 standard
    shipping containers. The ships were also configured for RO-RO (Roll
    on – Roll off) operations similar to ferries. Each of these ships
    can lift the equipment of a standard Motor Rifle Regiment (MRR) or
    Tank Regiment (TR) and other supplies and equipment.

-   Thirty (30) RO-RO ships. These ships are critical for rapid
    unloading in a beachhead area, they require some form of pier, or
    ferry dock to unload but can probably unload onto the rear of a
    Ropucha class for ship allowing the vehicles to drive through that
    ship onto a causeway or beach. It would take 3-4 of these ships to
    transport a MRR or TR.

-   Seventy (70) passenger ships with a capacity to carry 150-200,000
    troops under wartime conditions. To transport an MRR with about
    2,500 troops, one or two large passenger ferries or small liners
    would likely be sufficient over short distances.

-   Six hundred (600) ships with heavy lift booms capable of lifting
    more than 40 tons. These ships are both self unloading but can also
    assist other ships in unloading in a small port, providing there is
    a pier available. These can also be augmented for speedier unloading
    by using port infrastructure but having ships that can self unload
    provides significant flexibility to the amphibious force.

-   Six hundred (600) cargo ships with the speed, capacity and range to
    be useful for amphibious or support operations. Many have cranes but
    less than 40 ton capacity.
