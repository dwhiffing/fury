**United Kingdom:** The UK is one of the founding members of NATO and is
arguably the second most important military power behind the US. This
status is arguable because Germany, Turkey and Italy, not to mention
France have become increasingly important while the UK military forces
have shrunk considerably since the formation of the Alliance. For a
better understanding of the entities that make up the UK, you may wish
to watch this humorous but
accurate [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10). In 1994
the British military had reduced to about 250,000 personnel, but was
technologically advanced and highly proficient.

Territorial commitments, disputes and agreements are too numerous to
mention but the UK has global commitments which it struggles to
maintain. However, despite the difficulties since 1982 the British
forces have fought and won in the Falklands, the Gulf War, Yugoslavia
and Bosnia, along with a continuing commitment to Northern Ireland,
Belize, Brunei, Hong Kong, Kenya, Cyprus and Gibraltar.
