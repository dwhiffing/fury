**France:** Although France left the NATO military command structure in
1966, it was one of the 12 founding members. In Northern Fury, France
rejoins NATO within 7 hours of the war starting. France has several
overseas territories and global commitments to maintain.

The significant military inventory fielded by France is hindered in
several ways: The near 30 year absence from NATO means that
interoperability with other nations has suffered; France's defence
industry had fallen behind technologically in some areas leading to long
development times (Rafale took 25 years from contract to fielding),
excessive build times (12 years for the Aircraft Carrier Charles De
Gaulle), neither of which are available for Northern Fury; Limited sales
within NATO but significant sales to potential enemies (Dassault Mirage
type fighters, Exocet SSMs, Crotale SAMs etc); Several unique but dated
doctrinal anomalies remain within the French structure, (Light Armoured
Divisions etc).
