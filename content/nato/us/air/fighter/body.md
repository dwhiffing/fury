**USAF Fighter & Multi-Roll**

By 1994 the USAF had almost slimed its front line fighter inventory down
to two basic airframes, the F-15 Eagle and Strike Eagle, and the F-16
Falcon. In Northern Fury however, three squadrons of updated F-4E
Phantoms lingered on in the Air National Guard (ANG).

The F-15 is an all weather, highly maneuverable air superiority fighter.
Arguably the best air superiority aircraft in the world, none have been
lost in air combat. In 1994 there are two basic variations on the Eagle,
the F-15A which is limited to the original suite of weapons that were
developed for the aircraft in the early ‘70s, and the F-15C which is
able to use a much more modern Aim-120 AMRAAM air to air missile. It
should be noted that the twin seat trainer versions are the ‘B’ and the
‘D’ models and each squadron has two or three of these for continuation
and certification training. The link above has many more details as does
the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle)
and many other pages. By the beginning of Northern Fury almost all F-15A
are in the ANG, while the regular air force is equipped with the F-15C
with one exception; the 57<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron (FS) stationed
at Keflavik Iceland. All of the F-15C on active service have undergone
the MSIP (Multistage Improvement Program) upgrade. Northern Fury uses
the same number of airframes that were originally produced, however in
the real world the squadron size had been reduced to 18 aircraft, a
couple squadrons had been deactivated and many older F-15A had been
retired to the bone-yard. The chart below gives a comparison of where
the aircraft were in real life and where they are in Northern Fury[1]:

Squadron distribution in Northern Fury remains relatively consistent
with history but two regular Squadrons due to deactivate in 1994
(32<sup>nd</sup> FS and 43<sup>rd</sup> FS) are not planning to do so,
and one additional ANG Squadron is in the mix due to the shortage of
F-16s (112<sup>th</sup> FS). One other minor change is that Bitburg AB
in Germany did not close so the 53<sup>rd</sup> FS remained there
instead of moving to Spangdahlem AB. The most substantive change is the
retention of 24 aircraft per squadron vice the historic reduction to 18;
the exception is 57<sup>th</sup> FS which had never been at 24. Squadron

[**F-15E Strike
Eagle**](http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104499/f-15e-strike-eagle/)

The unquestionable success of the F-15 as an air-to-air platform
predictably led to a derivative able to conduct air-to-ground missions.
The F-15E Strike Eagle can do everything that the F-15C can do, but has
a rear seat for a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) and is optimally
configured for a deep strike into enemy territory using terrain
following radar and precision munitions. It has a powerful integrated
electronic countermeasures (ECM) system, conformal fuel tanks for added
range and plenty of weapon stations. Historically production trickled
off in ‘92 to just 3 aircraft but at its peak in ’87 and ’88, and again
1991, 42 aircraft were produced. Northern Fury has this production
maintained through ’89 and ’90 (an increase from 35 each year) and
continuing into ‘93. Overall increasing the production by 100 aircraft.
Factoring in attrition there are now 301 Strike eagles available which
translates to one additional wing (6<sup>th</sup> Tactical Fighter Wing
at Mountain Home AFB, ID) and the continuation of 550<sup>th</sup> FS as
the conversion training unit into mid 1994.

[**F-16 Falcon**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-16.htm)The F-16
is the most numerous and versatile fighter in the USAF inventory. First
entering service in 1978, there are numerous variations to the basic
airframe, the details can be found at this
[site](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions.html). In general terms
variants were produced in ‘Block’ numbered groups indicating major
upgrades. Historically the late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a massive
downsizing and sell-off of this ubiquitous and adaptable fighter. Many
went to the Air Guard, many went into long term preservation and yet
more were sold to allies. In Northern Fury the 1988 level of production
(180/year) was maintained right through 1993 and is planned to continue
for at least 3 more years. Factoring in a slightly higher level of
attrition, this production results in an additional 442 airframes being
available, most at the Block 40/42 and 50/52 standard. Combined with
retaining some older aircraft in the Air Guard, not retiring the
F-16ADF, and canceling several foreign sales a net increase of 15x F-16
Squadrons is available. The aircraft in use by the USAF in Northern fury
are:

-   **F-16A** – Over 800 of these were built from 1978 through 1983, in
    the mid ‘80s about 520 were converted to the ‘Air Defence Fighter’
    (ADF) version for NORAD and the remainder were shunted to secondary
    roles or preserved. One squadron used for training ANG pilots is
    still equipped with these aircraft, 40 more are undergoing refit to
    ADF and about 150 are in storage.

-   **F-16ADF** – these are upgraded ‘A’ models to the Block 15
    standard, and specially optimized for the US ANG intercept mission
    for NORAD. These are the only US F-16s that fire the [Aim-7
    Sparrow](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_armament_article10.html) missile.
    About 520 were modified for this role, which due to the shortage of
    new aircraft was about 250 more than historically exited, and more
    are being converted.

-   **F-16C/D Block 25** – This was the earliest version of the ‘C’
    model and had a better radar, a glass cockpit, improved fire control
    computer and many other improvements. Fundamentally this looked like
    the ‘A’ model but was able to fire the much more capable [Aim-120
    AMRAAM](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_armament_article3.html) and [AGM-65
    Maverick](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_armament_article4.html). With 280
    (vice 244 in real history) of this Block produced it is resident in
    three ANG Squadrons, three training Squadrons and one European based
    regular squadron. This leave 33 in storage after 49 have been
    written off through accidents and other losses.

-   **F-16C/D Block 30/32** – There are two main upgrades in this block,
    first and foremost is the ‘common engine bay’ and two improved
    engines. The General Electric F110 (Block 30) which equips 75% of
    the production run and the Prat & Whitney F100 (Block 32). The later
    Block 30s have a larger engine intake, commonly called the ‘Big
    Mouth’. The second major improvement is better target processing.
    All were later retrofitted with a
    [LANTERN](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_armament_article2.html) Pod for
    terrain following and targeting and the ability to engage targets
    with [HARM](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/smart/agm-88.htm)
    missiles. Northern Fury only increases this version by 20 airframes
    bringing the available number to 489 minus the 49 which were written
    off. No ANG squadrons have yet received this aircraft which equips
    11 regular squadrons, one of them a training squadron. About 100 of
    these machines are in storage.

-   **F-16C/D Block 40/42** – This version has a fully integrated
    LANTERN Pod giving the aircraft full day/night capabilities. Also
    improved were the ECM systems and cockpit controls. The first major
    production year was 1988 and the increase in Northern Fury
    production takes hold in 1989, so production of this version is 760
    vice the historic 454. After removing 53 for crashes and accidents,
    a total of 25 squadrons including three training squadrons are
    equipped with this aircraft.

-   **F-16C/D Block 50/52** – The last version equipping the USAF in
    Northern Fury has improved engines, avionics, radar and ECM. These
    aircraft are destined to replace the Wild Weasel in the Suppression
    of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) role. Production began in late 1991 and
    continues at an increased pace. By the start of Northern Fury there
    are 304 available after removing 33 due to attrition. There are none
    in the training system but 11 front line squadrons are equipped with
    this version.

[**F-4E
Phantom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-4_Phantom_II)

Although this venerable fighter served well into the late ‘90s in the
Wild Weasel and Reconnaissance roles, the pure fighter version within
the USAF was supposed to retire in 1992. The shortage of F-16s caused by
the retention of squadrons in Europe has meant that in Northern Fury
there are still some F-4Es remaining in the Air National Guard. About
100 F-4Es were converted to carry a wider range of ordinance, including
Laser Guided Paveway II bombs, they are still capable of conducing
Air-to-Air combat but are heavily outclassed by the latest Soviet
fighters. Three ANG squadrons retain the Phantom which will likely serve
into 1996 before there are enough F-16s available to retire them.
Additionally, a squadron of this type operated by ATEC trains German
Luftwaffe crews.

[1] The total production figures are derived from: Donald & Lake, The
Encyclopedia of World Military Aircraft, Aerospace Publishing 2000, had
355 ‘A’ and 57 ‘B’ totaling 412 plus 408 ‘C’ and 62 ‘D’ totaling 470.
The production numbers at the FAS link are similar but do not seem to
include F-15B production of 57.
