**Special Operations Aircraft**

The AFSOC fleet of aircraft is small but highly specialized. Hurlburt
Field in Florida is the home of this command which runs its own school
as well as a test and evaluation organization. Both of these facilities
allow the command to remain very agile in adopting new technologies and
fitting them to their aircraft rapidly.

[**AC-130A/H/U Spector/Spooky
Gun-ship**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/ac-130.htm)

These are one of the most unique aircraft in the USAF inventory. A
converted C-130, these very complex airframes have side firing 20mm and
30mm auto cannons (24mm Gatling gun for the AC-130U ‘Spooky’) and a
105mm howitzer, converted for precision fire. Both the Spector and, more
so the Spooky have extensive electronic and physical countermeasures
available for self-protection and jamming of enemy air defence. The 13
remaining AC-130As are the oldest Hercules airframes in the USAF
inventory, but have had extensive strengthening to keep them operational
and are flown by the 711<sup>th</sup> Special Operations Squadron (SOS)
Air Reserve. After the loss of an AC-130H in the Gulf War, the order for
new AC-130Us was increased to 13. Historically the Spooky underwent an
extensive testing period before being accepted for operations, in
Northern Fury, that testing was undertaken while the aircraft were on
the operational squadron, 8 of the eventual 13 have been delivered with
the remainder arriving at a rate of one per month.

**[MC-130P](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/mc-130p.htm) Combat
Shadow**

The Combat Shadow flies low altitude, high threat, penetration missions
to provide air to air refueling for Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) or
other special mission aircraft, primarily helicopters. They can also
drop small Para teams or cargo into a threat area. Historically these
aircraft did not change designation from HC to MC until 1996, in
Northern Fury they have already done so. There are 37 Combat Shadow in
service, 5 in the Air Reserve; this is 9 aircraft more than actually
existed in 1994.

[**MC-130E/H Combat Talon
I/II**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/mc-130e.htm)

The Combat Talon conducts deep penetration air drop missions in a high
threat environment. Using terrain mapping radar, terrain avoidance
avionics, GPS and impressive ECM capabilities, in-flight refueling these
aircraft specialize in low level long distance precision para drops deep
in an opponent’s territory. Equipped with, a recovery system for
retrieving a person from the ground or water, when a balloon is unfurled
and the Combat Talon snatches the cable. AFSOC has an inventory of 24
‘Combat Talon I’ and 24 ‘Combat Talon II’ aircraft, this is 10 more
‘Combat Talon I’ then existed in 1994.

[**MH-53J Pave Low
III**](http://www.americanspecialops.com/usaf-special-operations/aircraft/mh-53-pavelow/)

This is a heavy lift helicopter with impressive
[capabilities](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/h-53.htm). The two
main roles are Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) and insertion/extraction
of Special Forces teams. The ‘Pave Low’ is one of the few helicopters in
the world that can be fueled while in flight, and it is the most
powerful helicopter in the US military. Both the USN and USMC use the
CH-53 but within the USAF, AFSOC is the only user. There are 41 of these
aircraft in the inventory. A history of the Pave Low helicopters is
[here](http://www.afsoc.af.mil/Portals/86/documents/history/AFD-131112-025.pdf).

**[MH-60G Pave Hawk](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/uh-60.htm)**

A member of the UH-60 Blackhawk family of helicopters, the Pave Hawk
augments the MH-53’s in both the CSAR mission and in delivering,
supporting and extracting Special Forces teams. They have an all-weather
radar, a retractable refueling probe and auxiliary fuel tanks to extend
both the range and the acceptable conditions under which missions can be
flown. 55<sup>th</sup> SOS ‘Night Hawks’ operate 10 of these helicopters
from Hurlburt Field, Florida.
