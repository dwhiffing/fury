**Indian Ocean Fury \#6: Into the Breach**

22 Feb 1994, Zulu, Local

You’re commanding CTF 154 centered on the USS Saratoga CVBG and
other forces in the Persian Gulf region. Your primary task is to
transit the Straits of Hormuz in an effort to impress Saudi Arabia to
commit to the conflict on our side. However, a critical secondary task
is to ensure the safety of a major oil convoy heading to Europe, and of
course tie down Soviet and Soviet aligned forces (primarily Iran) so
they cannot interfere in other theatres. Finally, you must do all of
this, while preventing the spread of the war and remaining disengaged
from the parallel India/Pakistan conflict that is now raging.

The 5<sup>th</sup> Fleet has just undergone a restructuring, mostly
because /assets and resources are flowing out of the theater at a quick
pace. Your Task Force is, by far, the most powerful left in the region
so political several imperatives are becoming paramount. Keeping the
Gulf States fighting and coordinated is becoming difficult and
Washington want’s Saudi Arabia to join the fight on our side. The
scenario provides you with many diverse tasks to accomplish, several of
which conflict with each other.

The critical task however is to impress Saudi Arabia enough to bring
them on-side, so far they have been delicately balancing their options.
To do this, you need to sail your Carrier into dangerous waters.
