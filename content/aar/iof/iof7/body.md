**Indian Ocean Fury \#7: Deep Strike**

26 Feb 1994, Zulu, Local

You are commanding the 366<sup>th</sup> Expeditionary Fighter Wing which
is a unique organization in the USAF. You flew into Cairo about ten days
ago and have been conducting missions in the Eastern Mediterranean and
Red Sea areas since then. Tonight, is something different. This morning
you had a phone call from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the
Pentagon, not something you expected. Apparently, the Soviets have been
helping the Iranians with their nuclear program and the Israelis are
more than a little uptight. Since Washington wants to keep Israel from
acting independently and causing all sorts of problems with our Arab
allies, we have been given a new tasking.

Reinforced with some BONEs and a Blackbird who are flying in from the
US, your job is to go deep into Iran and knock out the nuclear
facilities â€“ without causing any radioactive fallout of course. Simple!

**<u>Indian Ocean Fury \#7</u>** Puts you in the position of conducting
a long-range precision strike on three nuclear facilities deep within
Iran. Unfortunately, some of your /assets are less than precise
instruments, and the consequence of collateral damage is catastrophic.

As Fury scenarios go, this one is fairly straight forward, however Iran
is not defenceless and your /assets are not all ideally suited for the
task.
