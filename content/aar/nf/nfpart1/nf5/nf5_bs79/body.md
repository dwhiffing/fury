**<u>Northern Fury \#5 – Bardufoss Blues</u>**

**<u>AAR by bladesinger79, Jul 2022</u>**

This was just a badass crazy battle. Took about three months to complete
it, I am sadly an older gamer with a job and family to burn up 90% of my
waking hours.
Horrible. <img src="/assets\images\aar\nf\nfpart1\nf5\nf5_bs79\image1.gif" style="width:0.15625in;height:0.17708in" alt="8-)" />  
  
The air war didn't quite turn out the way I wanted, there were just too
many Russians to deal with and didn't have enough good planes on my end.
Typical Russian tactic: We have more of us than you have ordinances to
kill us! My pilots managed to kill well over 100 of them to losing about
20 of ours, but they ultimately held the skies from Bodo to Russia. I
did NOT expect the Finns to turn against us, they will pay later in the
way I guess. Managed to keep all of the Grim Reapers (493 US sqn) alive
so that helps.  
  
The Battle of Lofoten was what won it for me. After sinking three enemy
subs, I had clear sailing from there on because the Russians did not
have any ground-attack aircraft to attack any ships. Even better, I
managed to shoot down all 12 enemy Il-38 Mays, freeing up my subs. When
the Utsira sank an SAG, and the combined efforts of Missile Group Falk
and TG Bergen sank another one, I ordered them on a suicide run against
the amphibious group to engage with guns and torpedoes. FOR THE GLORY OF
NORWAY! Once we were in range, the unthinkable happened:  
  
THE RUSSIAN SHIPS NEVER FIRED BACK!!!  
  
Taking advantage of the scenario design flaw (It was later revealed I
could edit the WRA for the enemy to make it realistic), I spent the
better part of nine hours destroying each and every enemy ship in that
group! With them out of the way, Trondheim was safe.  
  
The icing on the cake occurred when my fighters shot down practically
every ASW helo in TG Kusnetsov. It took about seventeen hours to do so
but when I did, it cleared a path for the USS Annapolis to sit deep and
silent in front of the formation and sank both the Kuznetsov AND the
Kirov!!! For some reason, they came to a full stop at about three hours
left in the battle. So I emptied my tubes and destroyed the crowning
jewels the Russians had in the Atlantic!  
  
MAJOR DECISIVE ASS WUPPIN'!!!!  
  
Details follow:  
Z1208. Air war begins. Used groups of F-16As from Sqn 331 and F-5As from
Andoya to initiate enemy long-range missiles and outrun them in
afterburners, while groups of 493 Eagles returned fire from angles. It
was fire-and-flee tactics that did not always work against afterburning
enemies. First wave was made up of MiG-23MLD Flogger K’s. I had
determined that all F-5As were sacrificial lambs, as their capabilities
are next to nothing. Not good leadership but it’s just a game.
Long-range missile hits were 50-50. Flt 4587, 340 Sqn \#3-4 sacrificed
to save two F-16AMs to escape. Finnish air units join the war. 23 MiGs
shot down at this point.  
  
Z1222. Battle of Lofoten begins. Two Flankers from the SCG sped to
attack my Orion, ended up firing at my fighters. One Flanker hit my
Orion with heavy damage but was shot down by F-16s for his zealousness.
The Orion \#5 is forced to land at Bodo despite enemy fighters closing
in from the east. Yak-38 Forgers were getting shot down by a combination
of fighters and TG Bergen, they never had a chance. The Utsira managed
to slip past the ASW helos, lowered to deep depth and waited for their
chance against a surface group of four ships. The HMS Talent closes in
on another group but faces a stiffer challenge against more radical ASW
units. The USS Annapolis is desperately fleeing away from a wave of ASW
units from both the Kiev and Kutnesov groups. Another Su-33 shot down a
fighter from the RNLAF before going down itself.  
  
Z1226. Thanks to the brave F-5A pilots dogfighting against the enemy
wave, this placed the enemy within firing height of the SAM battery at
Bardufoss. They suffer massive casualties against missiles coming from
the both the battery and from long-range firing Eagles. Current losses:
2 F-5As, 1 F-16A vs 26 MiG-23MLD-K, 2 Su-33, 5 Yak-38s.  
  
Z1228. Battle of Lofoten. Enemy sub spotted by sonobuoy near shoreline,
but not risking an attack by my ships. More Forgers are attacking but
they are nothing more than just target practice. My lone supporting
flight of F-15Cs are shooting at helos before I order them to stop,
killing all they shot at. A skilled Forger shot down RNLAF \#3 and 4,
lucky. Sonobuoys are thick for surface group causes the HMS Talent to
break off.  
  
Z1233. More planes from Evenes and Andoya take off, speeds low and fast
to avoid air conflicts. Second enemy wave arrives near Bardufoss, with a
few attempting to engage my picket of Eagles. After a few kills, the
wave near Bardufoss breaks off pursuit. All my fighters head to Orland.
Large amount of land-based Su-27 Flankers speeds on afterburner towards
my fleeing planes.  
  
Z1235. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. All Yak-38 Forgers successfully shot down.
Fearful of enemy subs, I attempt to use the coastline to skirt my ships
away from impending enemy air attacks. Dared not send any Orions to
clear a path for them. Utsira in position to attack SAG Kresta near
Vesteralen Island.  
  
Z1236. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Utsira begins attack on SAG Kresta. The Kinn
attempts to intercept known enemy sub before it attacks TF Bergen.  
  
Z1244. Sovremenny sunk by Utsira.  
Z1248. Ornevoy (Mod Kashin) sunk by Utsira.  
  
Z1250. Bombardment of Bardufoss begins. Enemy destroys a gun emplacement
there. Five Flankers blitz towards Bodo, many head for other bases.
Circle jerk of Flankers, Fulcrums, and others form east of Evenes,
preventing any more planes from launching out of there.  
  
Z1252. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Kresta II sunk by Utsira.  
Z1257. Udaloy II sunk by Utsira. Heads for shallow waters near Andoya.  
  
Z1306. All pursuing Flankers shot down NE of Orland but lost 1 F-5A and
one damaged. One F-16AM lost, glitch.  
  
  
Z1307. Attack on Andoya begins. Nearly all initial enemy fighters were
shot down. NASAM site did well. Managed to sneak 493 \#19-20 past the
Flankers and made a dash for Orland.  
  
Z1310. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Sent missile group Lom to try and distract the
enemy Kilo sub from TG Bergen. P986 Hauk sunk. P960 sunk. Msl Gp Lom
destroyed. Kinn barely avoids torpedo, forced to surface due to dead
batteries. TG Bergen makes a break north hoping to avoid subs.  
  
Z1331. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Utsira sinks enemy sub, unknown model type but
is under attack by torpedoes. 340 Sqn \#9-10 attempts to shoot down
enemy helos with guns, they suck.  
  
Z1340. Lull in the conflict. A lone Su-27S pursues my planes enroute to
Orland. The Annapolis and Talent continues to speed away from enemy
ships, while TG Bergen steams north to engage and avoid subs. Utsira
heads south to avoid enemy Mays bearing on him from Russia. Over 50
planes rearming and refueling at Orland. The Kinn is cautiously
searching for hunter-killers. The lone Flanker retreats, probably low on
fuel. Changed its mind when a pair of F-5As from Andoya flew close by.
Shot down by CAP of Eagles. Current score: 7 total fighters, 3 missile
boats lost vs. 60 enemy fighters, four ships, two subs.  
  
Z1410. Managed to trap two more Su-33 Flankers from their CAP to chase
my planes near Orland. They may turn back due to fuel. The Utsira is
tracking down an enemy sub that fired at it earlier. A circle jerk of
Mays huddle 120 nm west of Andoya waiting for trouble.  
  
Z1418. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Kinn fires on enemy sub contact to its rear.
The attack succeeds, sinking a Kilo-class sub.  
  
Z1434. New wave of fighters heading into the fight from Russia and
Finland. Several are flying at 40,000 feet, suggesting they are probably
the Foxhounds.  
  
Z1435. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. A group of four enemy helos approach TG Bergen
with ill intent. TG fired missiles at the low flying birds. All were
shot down.  
  
Z1450. Large wave of enemy fighters is heading southwest to Orland and
Bodo, possibly Foxhounds. All my F15s are out of fuel and grounded or
RTB. All I have left that can fly are F16s and F5s. Enemy wave circles
just east of Bodo, teasing me to get closer, which I won’t for now.  
  
Z1515. A pair of Il-38 Mays attempted to intercept the Kinn, they were
shot down by TG Bergen. That group is running out of Sea Sparrows. They
are heading out to open seas.  
At odd intervals, Il-38 Mays and helos will end up getting shot down by
the SAMs from Andoya and TG Bergen too often to keep track.  
  
Z1610. Wave of fighters break off, headed back to Russia. Lone chance to
launch last 2 F-5As to join Orland. A continuous scattering of shoot
downs occurred here and there, mostly at Andoya, Evenes, and with TG
Bergen. Lonesome and pairs of Su-33 Flankers were lured out to deep
ocean by F-5s and were systematically picked off by F-16AMs and
F-15Cs.  
  
Z1612. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Goblin contact by Kinn, closes in for the
potential kill, while the Utsira speeds south away from the ASW net. Msl
Gp Falk closes the gap on second SAG, the Yunashev.  
  
Z1644. Two F-5s from Bodo attempted to shoot down an Il-38 May close to
TG Bergen. Five shots, zero hits. Both 336 Sqn \#3-\#4 were shot down.
Pathetic.  
  
Z1708. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Msl Group Falk begins attack on SAG Yunashev.
First four shots from P970 Brann fired at Otchnayanny (Sovremenny
class), Russian ship put up a LOT of SAMS! All four shot down. A massive
wave of enemy fighters, mostly Su-27 Flankers and MiG-31 Foxhounds, head
towards Orland. All available NATO craft are launched for the big
showdown. Second flight of Penguins shot down. Enemy wave breaks off
150nm from Orland, perhaps due to fuel, but Foxhounds continue to
advance. Fired last eight Penguins from Falk. Otchayanny hit three
times. DDG of unknown name hit four times, sunk. The Talent closes in.  
  
Z1730. I’ve turned several flights northeast to trap a few enemies
closer to within range of my Orland SAMs and to drain their fuel out.
They don’t fall for it, they turn back within a few nm of my SAM range.
Only when I risked sending a few flights did I manage to kill a few
Su-27s. None of the Foxhounds bit on the baiting trap.  
  
Z1800. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Kinn attacks Goblin contact, with Utsira
closing in 17nm away. HMS Talent within range of one ship from SAG
Yunashev, waits for all three to close in before firing. Spotted by the
enemy, probably by a Sonobuoy, and launches all torpedoes while dodging
an enemy torpedo. Kinn misses its target, torpedo exploded by a glitch.
The Mod Kashin was sunk by a Spearfish torpedo, but the Talent is on the
run by a homing torpedo.  
  
Z1812. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Kinn sinks enemy sub of unknown make and
model. Yunashev hit by torpedo.  
  
Z1900. Continuous game of baiting going on around Orland. Foolish enemy
craft comes in individually or in pairs against my own numbers with no
casualties to this point. Either they get shot down or run out of fuel.
Either way, I’m winning. A flight of F-15Cs \#9-\#10 are picking off
enemy ASW units too far from their surface groups for any SAM support.
Orland SAM site of Hercules have been sub-par to pathetic, but thankful
I have them. RNLAF 332 Sqn \#13-\#14 took on a total of 12 enemy
missiles and dodged them all as bait for the other flights to shoot down
the enemy.  
  
Z1923. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. TG Bergen attacks Amphibious group with
Penguin missiles. First 12 missiles did not pass through the beehive of
Russian SAMs, so they chose to attack with guns. TG Bergen comprised of
the Bergen, Stavanger, Skjold, Djerv, Rokk, Orn, and Snogg. They were
going to fight it out against superior numbers and firepower.
Rastoropnyy (Sovremenny class) hit by one missile. TG Bergen decides to
battle with guns by isolating enemy ships with numbers on their side
instead of charging into the fray. Rastoropnyy sunk by multiple cannon
hits and two torpedoes. Admiral Vasilyevsk (Udaloy-class) was next, hit
by dozens of shots, damaged and slowed. Soobrazitelny (Kashin-class) hit
by torpedo, slows down and minor fire, moderate flooding. Bessmenny
(Krivak II-class) and Otvazhny (Kashin-class) were attacked by final
torpedoes both missed. Vdumchivyy (Sovremenny-class) was next, damaged
but working. The Otvazhny (Kashin-class) suffered our wrath up close.
Ends with five Russian ships damaged, burning, and sinking in various
degrees. I sent the TG away to reload and regroup before attacking the
landing ships. NOT ONCE DID THE RUSSIANS SHOOT BACK!  
During this time, SAMs from Bardufoss, Andoya, and Evenes would fire at
low flying enemies, shooting down several of them from time to time.  
  
Z2023. Attacks the LST Ropucha I: Medium damage, major fire, heavy
flooding.  
Z2028. Attacks LST Ropucha II: Medium damage, heavy flooding.  
Z2033. Attacks a different LST Ropucha I: Heavy damage, Conflagration,
minor flooding.  
Z2039. Attack on LPD Mitrofan Moskalenko: Light damage, minor
flooding.  
Z2046. Attack on MLS Polnocny C: Sunk!  
  
Z2050. Msl Group Falk moves in to finish off the Yunashev. Uses all
guns, saving the last two torpedoes for later opportunities. It is
sunk!  
Z2051. Attacks on another LST Ropucha I: Heavy damage, minor flooding.  
Z2104: Attack on another LST Ropucha I: Medium damage, minor fire.  
I had broken off from the attack, ran out of ammo. The TG sailing east
to cover the Utsira and Kinn from enemy ASW planes. Missile Group Falk
and the HMS Talent are steaming to intercept the remaining ships in the
amphibious group.  
  
Z2150. Big air battle at Orland, didn’t go as well as I wanted. Ended up
losing 2x F-16aAMs, 2X F-16A from 331 Sqn and 2x F-5As from 340 Sqn to
only 9 Flankers. Seven more shot down by 493 Sqn.  
  
Z2220. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. Utsira and Kinn ran out of battery power. Sent
TF Bergen to cover them for recharging, as a May was circling nearby.
Talent and Missile Group Falk closes the gap on the Amphibious group.  
  
Z2307. TG Bergen shoots down 12th enemy Il-38. There should be no more
of them to deal with.  
  
Z2325. Sent a flight of F-15Cs to shoot down enemy ASW helos from the
Kuznetsov group. Utsira and Kinn are recharging batteries with TG Bergen
covering them. Seven are shot down, took some fire from the surface
ships with no damage.  
  
Z0010. BATTLE OF LOFOTEN. MSL Gp Falk begins gun assault on remaining
healthy ship in Amphibious group.  
First attack on the Krondstadt (Kresta II-class): sunk by torpedo.  
Z0029. Attack on Grozyashchiy (Krivak II-class): heavy damage, medium
fire, medium flooding. Sunk.  
Z0055 Attack on Polnocny (Med Landing Ship): Sunk  
Z0100. Torpedo attack on a Ropucha I (LST-class): Sunk.  
Z0102. Attack on damaged Ropucha I: Sunk.  
Z0112. Attack on another damaged Ropucha I: Sunk.  
Z0125. HMS Talent attacks Mitrofan Moskalenko (LPD-class)  
Z0143. Talent attacks Bessmenny (Krivak II class): Sunk.  
Z0157. Attack on Vdumchivyy (Sovremenny-class): Sunk.  
Z0205. Attack on Otvazhny (Kashin-class): heavy damage, moderate
flooding.  
Z0207. Talent resumes torpedo attack on Mitrofan Moskalenko:  
Z0220. Talent begins torpedo attack on Otvazhny: Sunk.  
Z0230. Talent torpedo attacks on Vdumchivyy and Soobrazitelny
(Kashin-class): both sunk.  
Z0240. Attack on Marshal Vasilyevsky (Udaloy I-class): Sunk.  
The entire Amphibious task force is destroyed. The Kinn, Utsira, Talent,
and TG Bergen turn towards Trondheim with almost all major ordinances
spent.  
  
Z0250. Flight 9426, of 493 Sqn \#1-\#2 begins shooting down enemy helos
of TG Kuznetsov in hope to clear a path for the Annapolis. 8 AMRAAMs
fired, 6 hits. They return to base.  
  
Z0308. A lone Helix A from the TF Kuznetsov tried to attack the HMS
Talent but is intercepted by Group Falk.  
  
Z0320. Flight 9427 of 493 Sqn \#3-4 attacks ASW helos of TG Admial
Gorshkov. 7 shots, five hits. They have no air units protecting them
from sub attack for now.  
Z0350. Five Su-27s in a five-point box formation speeds towards my
fighters at Orland. Two are shot down.  
  
Z0419. Decided to launch my four operational Orions to attack TF Kiev in
hopes of at least one Harpoon missile gets through.  
  
Z0445. No helos are in the air covering the two carrier groups. USS
Annapolis closes in deep and slow to avoid sonobuoys, while my Orion
flight flies low to sneak in their Harpoons.  
  
Z0452, the Orion flight launches all missiles at the Kiev-class battle
group. Sunk unnamed Udaloy-class.  
  
Z0630. USS Annapolis began setting up for an attack on the Kuznetsov
group. Positioned in front of the group 40nm out, dove deep and cut
engines. At Z0810, the ships came to a full stop with my sub just 3.4nm
away from the carrier!!! Must be a mission design. The same happened to
the Kiev group, they conducted a full stop also. At this range, it would
not have made a difference if they kept moving or not, so I took the
opportunity. I turned north, crept behind the carrier instead of being
parallel to it within their ASW weapon range, waited until I was a good
7nm out, fired all four tubes, and ran like hell. They didn’t react to
the torpedoes behind them at all. Four torpedoes struck, damage
assessment unknown. No reaction from the Russians. I waited, reloaded,
and attacked again. With six total torpedoes, the Kuznetsov is sunk! The
last torpedo targeted the Kirov. The rest of the ships tried to flee at
high speeds, but the Kirov was hit in the stern at Z0828: damage is
minor flooding.  
  
Z0903. With five total torpedoes, the Annapolis sinks the Kirov. The
rest of the group flees top speed away.  
  
At this point, I sped the remaining three hours until the scenario was
over. The Russians did not attempt any more attacks anywhere. I landed
all my remaining planes and gave the crews a rest. The Norwegian navy
sailed south in triumph, while the Annapolis sailed north then turned
west to Iceland.  
  
Final Score: 1565
